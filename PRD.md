# ⚒️ ThumbForge AI: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 🌟 The Vision
Content creation is chaotic. Between filming, editing, and SEO, managing the "face" of your video—the thumbnail—shouldn't be another headache. **ThumbForge AI** is built to be the clean, premium, and lightning-fast "storage vault" for creators who value their time and aesthetic.

---

## 🧐 The Problem
YouTube creators often have hundreds of thumbnail versions scattered across Google Drive, local folders, and Discord chats. Finding that "v2.1 Final" image from three months ago is a nightmare. Existing solutions are either too bloated or look like they were built in 2005.

## 💡 The Solution
A minimalist, high-performance web platform where thumbnails are organized, versioned, and easily accessible. No clutter. Just your art, Forge-style.

## 🧘 Human Philosophy
ThumbForge isn't just a database; it's a tool for creators. We prioritize **clarity over complexity**. If a feature doesn't make a creator's life easier or their dashboard prettier, it doesn't belong in the Forge.
